        <h3>Purpose for Taking Computer and New Media</h3>
        <p>I found that many of my peers have common reasons for taking this course. A theme I 
            noticed is that many are taking this course to get a better understanding of the effects 
            of media in today's society. While going through everyone's web page, I was able to see 
            many similar medias that effect everyone's life.

        <h3>Common Social Media Among My Peers</h3>
        <p>
            There are many Social Media applications in today's day in age. The most common ones 
            I have found with my peers are Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and LinkedIn. I use these 
            medias every single day as if they were an extension of my body.

        <h3>Media That Stood Out</h3>
        <p>
            If there was one media that stood out above the rest it was YouTube. YouTube seemed 
            to be used by everyone for music, streaming, education, etc. It was interesting to see 
            how common YouTube is because of the massive impact it has had in my life.
